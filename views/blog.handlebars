                        <p>Market trends help you understand the movement of key price indicators. Trends in Chicago show a 4% year-over-year rise in median sales price and a -3% drop in median rent per month.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps Frank Sinatra said it best when he deemed Chicago "my kind of town." From the minute you set foot in this gem of the Midwest, it will be hard to sing anything but its praises. Arts and culture abound at top institutions like The Art Institute, and you'd better choose between the Cubs and the Sox before baseball season starts. Although the winters can test anyone's resolve, Chicago summers ...are among the best in the world, with things to do every weekend, outdoor festivals, and Lake Michigan at your doorstep. It won't be long before Chicago makes you feel right at home
